# Data and Plot code for the paper "The complexity of a â€˜simple' predator-prey system: Nontrophic positive interactions generate unsuspected dynamics and dependencies"

This repository contains the code and processed results for the study:
ðŸ“„ "The complexity of a â€˜simpleâ€™ predator-prey system: Nontrophic positive interactions generate unsuspected dynamics and dependencies."

In this study, we examine how non-trophic interactions (NTIs)â€”specifically recruitment facilitation and refuge provisionâ€”influence predator-prey population dynamics.

The repository includes:

- Numerical simulations of predator-prey dynamics using ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
- Automated plotting scripts for visualizing results.
- Pre-processed Excel datasets for easy access to cleaned numerical results.
